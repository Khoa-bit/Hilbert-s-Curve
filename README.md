# Hilbert's Curve
This is my personal take on drawing Hilbert's Curve written in Python

Definition:
A Hilbert curve (also known as a Hilbert space-filling curve) is a continuous fractal space-filling curve first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891,[1] as a variant of the space-filling Peano curves discovered by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.

###### To try it out:
You just need to run main.py in a console/terminal
`python3 main.py`

###### Quick demo:

#### **What I have learned:**
- Significantly improve _Recursion_ knowledge
- Divide a _big problem_ into as many _smaller problems_ as needed
